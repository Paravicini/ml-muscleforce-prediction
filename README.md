This project focused on exploring machine learning architectures to efficiently predict muscle force from synchronized surface electromyography (sEMG) and ultrasound (US) images. Conducted under the aegis of the Institute of Integrated Systems Laboratories (ETHZ), the objective was to contribute to the creation of a wearable electronics setup for real-time force estimation, applicable in sports and rehabilitation scenarios, among others. The wearable aspect imposed stringent computational and memory constraints on the machine learning algorithms.

The project encompassed several key stages:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the sEMG and US image data for analysis.
- **Data Manipulation and Generation of Training Units:** Synchronizing each US image with its corresponding sEMG data points, accounting for differences in frame rates and sampling                                                             rates.
- **Model Training:** Designing and training machine learning models to accurately predict muscle force.
- **Inference and Visualization:** Implementing real-time inference and visualizing the results to validate model performance.
